Title: About Me

My name is Helmut, and I'm a Python developer. My passions include Django, performance optimization, code readability, and helping others become better Python developers.

In my spare time I like to spend time with my wife and kids, read, exercise, or watch Formula 1. And in my spare spare time I write more code. ;-)

I currently work as a Python consultant at [Tangent Solutions](https://www.tangentsolutions.co.za) in South Africa.

I am the creator of [Sequel Sermon](https://sequelsermon.com).
