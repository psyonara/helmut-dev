I asked Reddit about text editors vs IDEs. In particular, I asked VS Code users why they preferred it over IDEs like PyCharm, and then I asked PyCharm users why they preferred it over text editors like VS Code. The results were very interesting.

### Conclusion

Looking at the above, I can conclude a few things:

- Users who work with multiple languages frequently prefer VS Code, whereas users who work mainly with Python prefer PyCharm.

- Users who don't want to spend much time on set up and configuration prefer PyCharm, because of it's many out-of-the-box features.

- Users who like flexibility prefer VS Code because of its vast plugin ecosystem that lets them add virtually any needed functionality.

- The price of PyCharm Professional seems to be a significant factor.

- PyCharm users say that such deep language integration cannot be found in any text editor.

I myself am a PyCharm Pro user. The price is worth it to me, and my top reasons why I prefer it are:

- Deep language integration: Even though Python support in VS Code is very good, PyCharm has even better integration. This ranges from smart autocomplete to stellar refactoring tools. To a limited degree, VS Code has these as well (with plugins), but PyCharm takes it to another level.

- I like not having to look for and install multiple plugins before having the functionality I need. Plugins also make you dependent on 3rd parties, whereas in PyCharm everything is built-in and always works seamlessly.
